# Theory Question-Answers

## OOP Concepts
### 1. Abstraction
#### It is a process of hiding internal data and implementation details from the outer world.
### 2. Encapsulation
#### Encapsulation is a technique to impliment abstraction.
#### It involves bundling the data and the methods that operate on the data with a single unit, known as class.
### 3. Inheritance
#### It is a mechanism of code reuse.
#### The class that is getting inherited is called superclass and the class that inherits another class is called subclass
#### Multiple way to impliment inheritance:
#### 1. Using Modules : Concept of Mixins
#### 2. Using Class
### 4. Polymorphism
#### It allows many different implimentations of same method
#### We can implement polymorphism using duck-typing or inheritance
#### When we override the method of superclass it can be an example of polymorphism
