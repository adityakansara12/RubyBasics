# Theory Question-Answers

## OOP Concepts
### 1. Abstraction
#### It is a process of hiding internal data and implementation details from the outer world.
### 2. Encapsulation
#### Encapsulation is a technique to impliment abstraction.
#### It involves bundling the data and the methods that operate on the data with a single unit, known as class.
### 3. Inheritance
#### It is a mechanism of code reuse.
#### The class that is getting inherited is called superclass and the class that inherits another class is called subclass
#### Multiple way to impliment inheritance:
#### 1. Using Modules : Concept of Mixins
#### 2. Using Class
### 4. Polymorphism
#### It allows many different implimentations of same method
#### We can implement polymorphism using duck-typing or inheritance
#### When we override the method of superclass it can be an example of polymorphism

### 1. What is Ruby and how it is different from other programming languages(JAVA, C++, Python) ?
#### Ans:-
        Ruby:
            General features:
                a) True Object-oriented: No premitive datatypes,
                b) Open-source,
                c) Focuses on simplicity and productivity
                d) Clean and easy syntax
                e) Allows a new developer to learn quickly and easily.
                f) Interpreted
                g) Dynamic typed
                h) Duck Typing
                i) Contains smart garbage collector

            Frameworks built using Ruby:
                a) Ruby on Rails (ROR)
                b) Sinatra, etc.

        Difference from JAVA:
            a) JAVA uses compiler to gengerate ByteCode and uses Interpreter to run ByteCode.
            b) JAVA is not truely object oriented beacuse it contais some premetive datatypes.
            c) JAVA is relatively fast.
            d) JAVA code is verbose, which reduces its readability than Ruby.
            e) JAVA is both dynamically and statically typed while Ruby is only dynamically typed.

        Difference from C++:
            a) C++ is a compiled language.
            b) Parenthesis to call methods is necessary in C++, is optional in Ruby.
            c) C++ is relatively fast.
            d) Arguments to methods are passed by the value, where the values are always object reference.

        Difference from Python:
            a) Python is not truely object oriented programming language.
            b) Python has larger range of libraries.
            c) Python does not support switch case.

### 2. What are the main features of ruby?
#### Ans:-
###### Feature 1: Truely Object Oriented
###### Feature 2: Dynamically typed language
###### Feature 3: Interpreted language
###### Feature 4: Duck Typing
###### Feature 5: Smart Garbage Collector
###### Feature 6: Mixins
###### Feature 7: Built-In support for reg-ex
###### Feature 8: Supports exception handling

### 3. IRB(interactive ruby shell)
#### Ans:-
        IRB is an interactive programming environment that comes with Ruby.
        To invoke it, type: irb
        To exit IRB, type: quit or exit
